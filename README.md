At the beginning you will face this window:

This is the main game menu. Now there're only 2 options: to start a new game (game will be absolutely new even if you are playing one and accidentely pressed `Esc`) or to exit from app.

## Game

Here is a basic lineup (don't blame me, I don't play football at all) You are playing 5 vs 5, everytime you controll only one player in your team (left one). At the start of the game your controlled player is `3`, you can switch player anytime.

Note that controlled player has slightly higher movement speed

## Out

If the ball goes out of the field, you will see this popup for few seconds and then the ball will be played from the center

## Goal

If your team or your enemy scores a goal, you will have another popup for some time and you will be able to watch last moments before goal (`Replay` button):

In the future I'm think of changing bot's behaviour to something more beautiful and enjoyable
